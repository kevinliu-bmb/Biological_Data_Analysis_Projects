    "\n",
    "First, the automatic formatting of the cells must have erroneously recognized certain gene names as type date from the Supplementary Table 1 data by Moriarty et al. and converted them into 'D-MMM' format when the data was stored in MS Excel. The exported data from MS Excel file would then be written as it is shown in the incorrect 'D-MMM' format, resulting in the gene name inconsistency between the two papers' supplementary tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the measured expression levels of genes with longer half-lives are most likely inflated relative to those with shorter half-lives, as we would expect genes with shorter half-lives to have been degraded by the time of measurement. This is evident from examining the top 5 genes with the longest half-lives and their corresponding expression ratios relative to t=0h, where genes with larger expression ratios for 96h/0h consistently have longer half-lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the synthesis rates for the genes with high expression ratios of 96h/0h should be high assuming that Moriarty's findings on post-mortem cortical gene expression is correct. However, we did not see any overlap in genes that have the top 5 highest synthesis rates and the top 5 genes with the highest expression ratios. This suggests that Moriarty's hypothesis is most likely biased due to time progression and half-life of decay in mRNA."
